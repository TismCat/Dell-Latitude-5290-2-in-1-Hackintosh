# Dell-Latitude-5290-2-in-1-Hackintosh
Dell Latitude 5290 2 in 1 "fully" supported in Mac OS Sonoma 14.0
Specs: i7-8650u, 16gb ram, 256gb m.2 sata ssd, ir camera,BCM94360NG wifi card + all the other default stuff find on dell documentation 
Everything working except some minor things such as
Powermanagment:idk but sometimes I get 2 hours and other times i get 6 hours
Fount camera: the ir camera works (scary as shiz), but i broke the normal frount facing camera so i cant test it (ordered replacment cam, should be comming soon)
Wifi, ok so this ones tricky, everything works like having wifi on a normal mac (all the special features), but for some reason I have very bad wifi, but only at home, 
honesly idk what the problem is, at school the network is slower but my connection is faster, at home where my wifi is abt twice as fast as school, the connection is abt half as fast.
This seems to be a quality control issue? I see mixed results online abt people saying its perfect and some complaining abt the abysmal wifi, its so bad at home i cant watch FHD youtube
and have to change it to 720p.
This is my first repo so i dont really know what else to add.
Please feel free to msg me abt any questions on discord my @ is phrog#3781
